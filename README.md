Executes scripts when a number of wifi networks become available.

At every location has 0 or more wifi networks available. It's like a
fingerprint. We can use this information to trigger scripts (and send push
notifications) when we are at a certain location.

For instance, you enter the house and your phone sends a message to a server
which logs your time at home or switches the lights on before you enter the
room.
